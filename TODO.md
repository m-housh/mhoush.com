# TODO

- [x] Fix build issues with `loopwerk/Saga` > 2.2.0
  - The errors seem to originate from `stackotter/swift-cmark-gfm`.
- [x] Explore banner images as links, instead of requiring a photo in project.
  - This works now, it requires explicitly setting the `image` in the article metadata.
- [x] Colors seem off on home-page, but fine on articles and about tab.
  - This was due to dark-reader being turned on.
- [x] Fix twitter image setup, doesn't seem to work properly now when posting links on social media.
- [x] Update tailwind version
- [ ] Add tags list / sidebar
  - This is started, but needs some work.
- [x] Move images to Immich and use links in articles.
  - This works / is done, except `gif` images do not autoplay.
