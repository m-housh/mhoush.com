# Free quotes != good

I found myself re-reading the
[ACCA Quality Installation Standard](https://www.acca.org/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=b1d2a39d-fda8-4af9-b8de-0ae579bfe24a)
recently and it got me thinking about the industries tendency of offering free quotes. In this
article, I'd like to just focus in on the items that are required as what I'm calling "prior to
installation" items.

## Prior to installation

1. Ensure ventilation calculations are performed.
1. Building heat gain / loss calculation (Manual-J / Manual-N)
   1. Room x room for new construction or duct modifications.
   1. Block load for existing (can use original if available).
1. Proper equipment capacity selection (Manual-S / Manual-CS)
1. Properly matched systems (AHRI or CEE-AHRI)

Let's break the above items down to a rough estimated time to complete each of the items.

| Item                                | Time (minutes) |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Ventilation calculations            | 15             |
| Manual-J (data gathering)           | 30             |
| Manual-J (data entry / calculation) | 30             |
| Manual-S                            | 15             |
| AHRI                                | 15             |
| **Total**                           | 105            |

This is 1.75 hours just to do the calculations required to meet the QI Standard. This does not
include any of the time spent with the customer building value in you or your product
recommendations.

When you want to not guess at some of the calculations then a blower door test is generally required
in order to understand the leakage of the home, which adds even more time to the estimation process.
Depending on the understanding you are looking for, the blower door test can add 30-180 minutes.
This takes the total time to 2.25-4.75 hours.

## Pushing boxes

The majority of residential HVAC companies make the bulk of their income off of equipment sales, so
they have to "feed the beast" by skipping steps in both the installation of equipment and the sales
process in order to close jobs and keep the ship afloat.

This has helped contribute to these industry statistics:[^1]

- **Incorrect refrigerant charge in greater than 50-80% of systems.**
- **Improper airflow:**
  - **70% above the rated 0.5" w.c.**
  - **47% above 0.7" w.c.**
  - **85% undersized / inappropriate filter.**
- **70-80% of systems have at least one fault.**
- **90-100% if duct leakage is considered.**

## Consumer responsibility

Let me be clear, I don't think that all the blame is on the industry here. The culture today is that
everyone wants things for free and fast. They have been conditioned by online services and box
stores. Should we not cater to those that aren't willing to do their leg work? Is it really our
fault, if they don't care?

## Liability

While it's generally easy to shrug our shoulders and think that it's ok to just continue on because
all the competitors are doing the same thing. There is at least the possibility that skipping steps
can come back to bite you. If things ever went to litigation and the steps outlined in the QI
Standard are ignored, then there is high odds you would loose.

No matter what you do to try and protect yourself (having customers sign-off, etc) does not
adequately protect your company from litigation. There are stories out there where contractors were
still held liable for not performing load calculations even though the consumer signed off on it,
because it is not inline with "industry best practices."

## Summary

This has led me to the conclusion that free quotes are just bad for the industry in general. The
path forward is a challenge (changing perception is hard). I don't know that I have answers on what
the best path forward is, to be frank, but I do know that our current _status quo_ is subpar to say
the least.

Unfortunately, I don't think the change is going to come from the industry, but that it's going to
require the consumer base to be more educated and demand more from the industry. There have been
many organizations that have dedicated years to changing the skill levels of technicians in the
industry, they are very well needed / don't mistake my words here, however unless a company has
faced litigation or facing requests on a regular basis that demand better results, then why would a
company change!?!

I've been trying (unsuccessfully) to get rid of free quotes for 5+ years in my company. We try to
educate customers during maintenance visits and when scheduling equipment estimates, however only
about 10-20% choose to go down our paid Home Performance Assessment path. Our installation process
does follow the QI Standard for the items that pertain to the setup / commissioning of the installed
equipment, however there is just no sustainable way for us to completely follow the items outlined
in this article without charging for our time, because at the end of the day we still have to be
competitive in our market.

There are days that I can justify our actions to myself and also days that I just want to throw in
the towel / not sacrifice our integrity. Integrity is something that I take very seriously, after
all our companies tag line is _"Since 1954, Integrity is in the Housh!"_

As mentioned, I'm not sure what the best path forward is! I hate to not have answers, but some
problems are just complex and somewhat beyond our control.

Let me know what you think some good solutions are.

- Does your company follow the QI Standard?
- What are resources that you've found helpful in educating your customers?
