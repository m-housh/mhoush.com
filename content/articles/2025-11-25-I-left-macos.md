# I Left macOS

In this article, I'm going to discuss why I left macOS. As some may know, I've been a big apple
fan-boy for years. I have always liked their design aesthetics and hardware. I honestly still love
their hardware and have continued to use it for both desktops and servers that I run. The price
point and low power usage of the mac-mini has always been appealing to me.

## Why I Fell in Love with macOS

It was 2013 when I purchased my HVAC company, at that time I got thrown into a world of not only
learning how to **_own_** a business, but also was the **_IT support_** for the company. The first
thing I did was go out and buy a macbook-pro.

I should also say that at that time, I could barely use a computer. I had an old windows laptop that
I never used (probably running `vista` or `xp`). We had some typing classes back in high school and
an intro to programming or something along those lines, but aside from that I just never had much
need for a computer. I was never a gamer and could do most everything I needed on my iPhone.

With the purchase of the company we inherited several windows desktop machines that our office staff
were using, these were constantly breaking and I'd have to figure out how to resolve issues with
them. Every time I had to try and fix something on these windows machines I would want to throw a
hammer at the screen. I found windows very unintuitive to navigate versus the macbook-pro that I was
using personally.

It was not long after that I just decided to purchase all the office staff mac-mini's, I believe
just because I could more easily trouble shoot them.

## My Introduction to Programming / Automation

Fast forward a year or two, I was wanting to develop a way to automate our pricing. I had built some
pretty elaborate spreadsheets in `Numbers` (apple's version of `excel`). I started learning about
`applescript` and `Automator`, apple's built-in tools for controlling / communicating with different
services.

I took several months of playing around and built some automations that used my elaborate
spreadsheet and apple's `iBook Author` tool to develop an ebook that I wanted to use to present
equipment estimates / options to our customers.

I also started learning some other programming languages and built a purchase order system, built
using `python` and `flask`, which we've used for 10+ years at this point.

Over the years I have always had a disdain for a lot of the software we've used to run the business.
It seems that everything is built to cater to a bunch of different industries (I get it they need to
sell it), but it always makes the experience pretty terrible overall.

## macOS-26

Fast forward to this year when macOS-26 (`Tahoe`) was introduced. I really was not very happy with
the interface decisions (`liquid glass`).

I had become a power user that customized macOS to use a bunch of custom keybinds that I setup. I
built automated install scripts to set everything up the way that I like it.

I never got to the bottom of it, but macOS always seems to grow / take over your disk space with
"System" files despite using tools like `Onyx` to clean these directories, so I'd end up wiping my
disk and starting with a fresh install every year or two.

I'm also not an `AI doomer`, but I also don't want `AI` built-in to my operating system. I prefer to
run `AI` in an isolated environment that I have control over.

## Breaking Out of the Walled Garden

I have ran `Linux` on servers for years at this point. I've even tried to switch to linux as a
desktop OS a few times, but could never really get into the distributions that I was trying
(primarily `Fedora` and `Ubuntu`).

Being so deep in the apple eco-system where everything just works together was hard to step away
from.

After breaking my foot and having a lot of downtime on my hands, I decided to give Linux another
shot. I took an old `intel` based macbook that I had and installed `Omarchy` on it, which is based
on `Arch Linux` and is an opinionated distro geared towards developers or users who hate using a
mouse (like myself). I should note that the macbook I installed it on had reached end-of-life many
years prior and had just been sitting around collecting dust, but to my surprise it was fast and
usable right out of the gate.

I discovered that `Omarchy` wasn't really for me, there was a lot of stuff that I would have to just
get rid of, but it did open my eyes that it was probable for me to move to an `arch` based system.
Omarchy introduced some software tools that I could use as open-source replacements for several
items I need, like `LocalSend` as a replacement for `air-drop`.

I started with a minimal `arch + hyprland` setup, then started learning how to set everything up. I
was no longer fighting the OS for what keybinds I can use because I'm now able to customize
everything. I am also comfortable with all of the text based configuration (and actually prefer it)
versus having to use an application (GUI) for all my settings.

A lot of my day to day software that I used on macOS works just fine on linux anyways.

## Conclusion

While I've only been using my `arch` setup for 2-3 months at this point. I think there's low odds
that I'm going back.

I prefer being in control of everything I'm using. I am not going to say that my transition was
easy, or even say that **_you_** should try it either, as it took me months of being on the
struggle-bus to develop my system / workflows and that's just not practical for most.

For me though, this has made me less reliant on big-tech companies that are just making us their
product. I feel both more engaged in my software stack while less attached to my devices at the same
time.

Just about anything that I want to do is a couple keystrokes away, no more clicking application
icons, I don't even have a dock or application launcher. My base install of `arch` is around 40gb
versus 100gb on macOS.

I hope you've enjoyed this article and I really appreciate your time.
