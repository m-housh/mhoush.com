# Eulogy for Alicia Hollon

Thank you all for being here today to celebrate the life of Alicia Hollon—my life partner, my best friend, and without a doubt, one of the strongest women I’ve ever known.

Alicia was the heartbeat of everything I did and everything we built together. For the past 12 years, she was my partner in every sense of the word. Though our relationship didn’t follow a traditional path, our bond was unshakable. We first met in high school, nearly 30 years ago, and over the decades, our lives continued to intertwine—until we eventually chose each other, fully and forever.

Alicia had a gift for bringing order to chaos. Whether it was planning our adventures or keeping everything running smoothly at Housh—our business and shared mission—Alicia made sure the details were never overlooked. As our customer service representative, she wasn’t just the voice of our company—she was its heart. Clients loved her. They trusted her. Many of them felt like they knew her, and many truly did. She brought humanity into every conversation, empathy into every interaction.

But Alicia wasn’t just someone who kept things together—she was someone who inspired. She was an adventurer at heart. She loved the quiet magic of a forest trail, the thrill of being on the water, and the unconditional love of our two dogs, Coco and Annie. Nature was where she felt most alive. We shared so many hikes, camping trips, long weekends at the Lake Housh, so many beautiful moments outdoors, and I will carry those memories with me for the rest of my life.

Alicia was also a fighter—a fierce, relentless, courageous fighter. Over the years, she faced more health battles than most of us could imagine: a heart surgery, a kidney transplant, and cancer. But Alicia never allowed her struggles to define her. She faced each challenge with grit, grace, and an unbreakable spirit.

When I think of Alicia, I think of Rosie the Riveter—iconic, strong, unyielding. That’s who she was to me. A woman who rolled up her sleeves and got things done. A woman who led with strength, but also with kindness. A woman who broke molds and blazed her own trail.

She left this world too early—just 44 years old—but in that time, Alicia lived fully. She loved deeply. She gave endlessly. And she left a mark on everyone lucky enough to know her.
I miss her more than words can ever express. But I am grateful beyond measure that I had the privilege to walk beside her, to love her, and to be loved by her.

Alicia, thank you for every moment. You are, and always will be, the love of my life.
