# On This Day

It was on this day 45 years ago when you took your first breath. It's been almost 6 months since you 
took your last.  Honestly, it is still hard to believe!  There are days when it doesn't even seem
real and days when the weight of it is still too much to bear.

## The Secret Things Nobody Knows (or probably do)

I would be lying if I said the house doesn't feel completely empty without you!!!  

It took me months to get rid of the dying flowers from your wake, and to be honest there's still one 
that I haven't thrown out despite it being dead for months.  

I still can barely walk into the room where your ashes are. I've been to much of a pussy to even spread
any of your ashes, despite my convictions to do so.

It is often so painful to look at your pictures, although I am constantly reminded of our adventures
as I scroll through our photo memories everyday.

## The Turmoil of a Broken Man

I feel selfish that I did not honor you as I feel I should have while you were alive, but you loved me 
anyway.

That day you decided to go into hospice,  when you told me that you wish I had asked you to marry me,
broke my heart!  You always knew my stubbornness surrounding the topic, so you never pushed it.  Of 
course, as you said that day, you too always acted like you didn't care.

Hell, even writing this makes me feel like it's all about me despite my intentions.

It seems strange to talk about how I've matured at this age, but I know you would be proud that I didn't
just dive into a bottle of bourbon since you've been gone.  

Everyday I have to keep myself busy to make it to the next.

## I Wonder

I wonder if there is a recollection of time in the ether of energy of which you belong to now?  

I wonder if that dove that hung around the house was in some way you?  

I wonder if it will ever get easier?

## Conclusion

This all seems much more depressing than I was hoping.  I have been pretty silent since your passing because of
the realization that my priorities need adjusted.  I have been keeping off social media and trying to connect
in real life.  Everyone misses your face, your presence, your laugh, and your conviction! 

I want you to know that everyone is thinking about you on your birthday!  We all know that you would not want us
to pine over you, but we are!  Everyday we miss you!  Everyday we love you! Everyday we honor you!

I miss you! I love you!
