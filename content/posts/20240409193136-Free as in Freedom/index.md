This is a hot take kind of article, but here it goes the rant.

## This applies to me and you.

I'm writing this to remind myself somethings that I too often take for granted.
I am going to preface this whole article by saying that everything I'm going to
lay out / mention is something that I am personally guilty of. This is an open
reminder and call out of things that I feel should change.

# Our perspective is flawed

Nobody can dispute that the advances in technology have greatly improved our
lives. Like anything, though, there is a trade off.

## What is FOSS

FOSS is an acronym for "Free and Open Source Software". It is generally about
how software is licensed, meaning that the source code is available in the
public for review, allowing a broader spectrum of people than the originators of
the code to have input, look for bugs, redistribute the software, contribute,
etc. It does not however mean that the software should be no cost to the end
user.

This is where the word "freedom" comes into it. Overtime, as a society, we
generally now think of FOSS as "free" software. This takes what was originally a
noble / courageous idea and devalues it to the point that we now expect things
to be free. It encourages corporate greed to take advantage of people who
created something to solve a particular need, or as a hobby, expecting the
creator to handle the burden of maintaining / patching bugs while they profit
from it. Don't get me wrong, these corporations will also contribute back,
sometimes even donate money to the creators. I am not at all opposed to
capitalism, nor saying that these corporations are in the wrong. At the end of
the day, **_we_** created this problem.

## Current state and how we got here

Software services / giants create applications that we come to rely on. They
tempt / bait us with them being "free" or cheap, but that is because **_we_**
are their target. They bloat the software with tracking and telemetry to capture
data about us and sell us more products and services. Once again, if you're
pro-capitalism, it's somewhat hard to blame them for this. We're the gullible
sheep who will blindly eat out their grain bins.

I can remember back in the day when there were music pirating services on the
internet (napster is the one that comes to mind). As a giant music buff, I
quickly jumped on board with services like these. Back in those days, I was
young, didn't make very much money, so it was hard to afford the latest and
greatest tunes. I also remember back in this time frame a lawsuit from the metal
giants Metallica (other's words not mine ;)). At the time I remember thinking,
like many others, that Metallica didn't need the money, but then a comment from
Lars Ulrich the band's drummer struck a cord with me (pun intended). I'll will
paraphrase here, but it was something along the lines of "We're not pursuing
this for us, but for all of those (musicians) that come after us". After this
and reflection, I decided that I would not pirate music anymore.

Fast forward, now the majority do not purchases music / albums, we typically
utilize streaming services (myself included), sure it may be more fair to the
artists than pirating was, it can be argued that it's easier today for
independent artists to become known / discovered, I'm also in no way saying the
old school music industry wasn't a giant pile of dog poo, but I am saying that
who is really winning(?), it's the Spotify's and Apple Music's of the world,
that's who.

I'm also reminded of the great "MeasureQuick is now charging for services" that
happened in the HVAC industry. I have personally never complained and have
always supported this decision, because it is not sustainable to run a software
company and not charge for services, generally. Sure, you may not like their
pricing model, etc. Where I think they went wrong was not charging from the
beginning, as it sets the wrong expectation that is presumably hard to recover
from. There are those who took some of Jim's words / opinions in a way different
from how I do / did, which is fine, we're all entitled to our opinions. What is
often forgotten is that we're all also entitled to change those opinions. Heck,
I will probably be shouting a different story tomorrow, so be it!

## Conclusion

What I would like to encourage people to do is to support software development.
If an application is free, but has a donate button consider giving a donation.
If an application is free and they don't want to charge that's fine too, however
I would say to be suspicous, meaning is it free because **_you_** are the
product?!?

I would also encourage you to be active in communities and organizations that
foster community (HVAC School is a great example). Show appreciation and
encouragement, but at the same time don't be afraid to be critical or speak up.

At the end of the day, I hope to lift up my brothers and sisters, help to fight
against the corporations who abuse the little guy's and hopefully feel good
about my decisions.

Over the last few weeks, I have been going through my software and services and
looking for those donation buttons and giving back a little bit for the software
that makes my life better. Help change the narrative and remember that it's
about **_Freedom not Free_**.
