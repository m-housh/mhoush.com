This is part one of a series of articles to help HVAC technicians (or others) get
started in developing their skills to program / develop skills to help them automate
everyday tasks or just familiarize themselves with some of the tools used by programmers.

## Why

I think if nothing else, this series can help gain knowledge, tips, and tricks to make
you more comfortable with your computer. If nothing else, I hope that you will
at least learn how to use your `terminal` application and more specifically `vim` motions
and keybindings.

The goal of this article is to just get a machine setup with tools and to start exploring.
I am a shill for `macOS`, so all of these will be specifically geared
towards that and my workflows, most everything that is showcased should also work on `linux`
machines (not sure about `windows`), although you may have to search for specific instructions
on installing software for other platforms.

What I have learned on my journey in programming is that the more you can lean on small software
packages that focus on a single task, but do them well, the better.  The less you use your mouse and / or
keyboard shortcuts, the more productive you can be.  The more you can work with `text` files and formats
the more portable and transformable your workflows can be.
